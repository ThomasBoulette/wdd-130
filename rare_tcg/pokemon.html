                <p>The third rarest card in Pokemon is known as known as the no-1 trainer. this card was givin out during the 1997 Pokemon world championships to whoever won first place. however what makes this not one of a kind is becuase of how the tournaments are structred with multiple divisions as well as this card being used for multiple yearly championships results in this not being one of a kind<p>

                <p>The second rarest card in Pokemon is known as no-2 trainer. this is a bit different as this was a much smaller competion and the competion only happening once ment that the amount in existance is less than number-1 trainer. this was givin out to players who made it in second place during the tournament. this one was chosen as collectors seem to value it more than the 3rd and 1st place counterparts</p>
